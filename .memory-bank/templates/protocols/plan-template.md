# Plan — <TASK_ID>

## Goal

## Non-goals

## Inputs / source specs
- Task record: `.memory-bank/tasks/<TASK_ID>.task.json`
- Task index: `.memory-bank/tasks/index.json`
- Feature/Epic: ...
- REQ IDs: ...

## Richer execution inputs (optional)
- Source Artifacts: ...
- Normative Inputs: ...
- Verification Targets: ...

## Fallback basis
- If richer inputs are absent, record the classic basis used for execution:
  - feature doc
  - requirements / RTM
  - duo docs
  - related contracts / states / runbooks / testing docs (if needed)

## Constraints / invariants (MUST / NEVER)
- MUST: ...
- NEVER: ...

## Scope
### In scope

### Out of scope

## Proposed changes
### Touched areas (hypotheses OK)
- `path/to/file` — why

### Preflight-confirmed change surface
- Expected hints kept: ...
- Additional same-outcome files/areas and rationale: ...
- Hard `write_boundary` present and satisfied: yes | no | not set
- `forbidden_scope` / stop-condition check: clear | blocked

## Applicable quality gates
List only evidence-backed project-native checks required by the task record,
linked specs/PRD, or repository configuration.

- [ ] `<check name>`: `<cmd>` — proves `<task outcome or concrete risk>`
- No meaningful runnable check: `<not applicable | rationale>`

## Claim-linked RED / GREEN (T2/T3)
- applicability: applicable | not applicable
- accepted claim locator(s): <AC / REQ / exact canonical spec anchor>
- planned test/probe and environment:
- observable RED:
- corresponding GREEN:
- accepted not-applicable reason and alternative proof:
- T3 isolation, safe rerun, cleanup, and permission boundary:

## Fan-out plan (if needed)
- Delegated agent A: scope ...
- Delegated agent B: scope ...

## MB-SYNC handoff / owner
Scheduler or explicit standalone owner performs sync after verification/status
decision. `/exe` only records handoff notes.

An `explicit standalone owner` exists only when the user directly asked the
current top-level agent to close the task, or when the top-level
agent/orchestrator explicitly runs a manual workflow for one TASK and records
that it owns closure. Subagent prompts do not silently become closure
owners.

Checklist:
- [ ] Owner identified: scheduler | explicit standalone owner | human | none
- [ ] Explicit standalone owner basis recorded if manual closure is expected: user direct instruction | top-level manual workflow ownership | n/a
- [ ] `.memory-bank/` docs needing update (WHY/WHERE, no pseudocode): ...
- [ ] `.memory-bank/index.md` router update needed: yes | no
- [ ] RTM update in `.memory-bank/requirements.md` needed: yes | no
- [ ] Task registry/status update owner: ...
- [ ] Changelog update owner: ...
