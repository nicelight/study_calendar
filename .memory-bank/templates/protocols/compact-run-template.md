## Reuse Candidates (optional)
- receipt_status: current | superseded | supporting-only
- attempt:
- claim:
- command: <exact filters/arguments; secrets redacted>
- cwd:
- exit_code:
- input_state_basis: <declared pre-command source/config/dependency/runtime basis>
- completed_at:
- evidence: <concise redacted output or artifact path/checksum; no standalone workflow verdict markers>

## Evidence Verdict
This marker records local evidence only. It is not task closure and does not set
final task status.

Replace the placeholder with one exact marker:
VERDICT: PASS
VERDICT: FAIL
VERDICT: BLOCKED

## Closure Decision
Record task closure separately from the evidence verdict.

### Manual `/exe`

- explicit standalone owner present: yes | no
- owner basis: user direct instruction | top-level manual workflow ownership | none
- decision: status unchanged | `status: done`
- compact PASS and every fast-lane condition satisfied: yes | no
- task record evidence updated in `verify`: yes | no

Manual `/exe` may write only `status: done`, and only after exact compact PASS
plus every tier-policy fast-lane condition. `VERDICT: FAIL|BLOCKED` is evidence,
not manual lifecycle authority; leave status unchanged and hand off.

### Scheduler

- decision: none | `status: done` | `status: failed` | `status: blocked`
- reason/evidence link:

Only the scheduler records this branch under tier policy. If no authorized
closure owner acted, leave task status unchanged and hand off the recommendation.
